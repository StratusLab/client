NFS Storage
-----------

This is a prototype for a client-server implementation of an EBS storage 
module over a shared filesystem.
It currently supports the following primitives:
- create
- delete
- attach
- detach
- list

with sharing options in the pipeline.

Prerequisites
-------------
Server: python-paramiko, python-sqlite2, python-werkzeug
Client: python-argparse, urllib2 (usually installed)
A shared filesystem between StratusLab FE and nodes

Config
------
See the provided file volumes.properties. 

Limitations
-----------
* It reuses the passwords defined in /etc/stratuslab/one-proxy/login*.properties.
Currently, there is no certificate verification, so access is granted only on the 
basis of the correct CN (should be fixed)

Roadmap
-------
Should be merged with the existing storage prototype in essense, which does not
provide the same functionality.

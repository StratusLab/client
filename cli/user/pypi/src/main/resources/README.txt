=================
StratusLab Client
=================

This project contains a command line client and associated libraries
for accessing a StratusLab cloud infrastructure.  More information
about the StratusLab cloud distribution can be found at the
collaboration's website: http://stratuslab.eu/, including information
on configuring the client.


Installation
============

This package is intended to be installed via pip.  The following
should 'just work':

    pip install stratuslab-client

If this is done system-wide, the PYTHONPATH and PATH should already be
set up correctly.  If this is a local installation, then you may need
to set those environmental variables by hand. 

See the tutorials on the StratusLab website on how to use the client.


Feedback
========

To provide feedback about the client or to report bugs with the code
or packaging, please send an email to support@stratuslab.eu.
